# Adding 3D Effects

In this tutorial you will learn how to create spatial images.

The easiest way to add a 3D effect in DeepDrill is to pass in the 3D profile:
```bash
./deepdrill -v -o top.map -o top.jpg -p 3D.prf top.loc
```
![3D Mandelbrot Image](images/3D_1.jpg "3D Mandelbrot Image")

The contents of the 3D profile is rather simple:
```
[image]
depth = 1

[colors]
alpha = 45
beta = 45
```
The first key instructs DeepDrill to mix the synthesized RGB pixels with depth information from a normal map. The latter two keys define the direction of the light vector.

Another profile for computing spatial images is `relief.prf`. In addition to what the 3D profile does, it selects a special GPU filter called `relief.glsl`. This filter ignores the color information and translates the normal map directly into a grey-scale image:
```bash
[image]
illuminator = relief.glsl
depth = 1

[colors]
alpha = 45
beta = 65
```
Running DeepDrill with the profile results in the following image: 
```bash
./deepdrill -o top.jpg -p relief.prf top.map
```
